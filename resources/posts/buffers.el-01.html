<p>Switching between the two most recent buffers is something I do often enough to warrant its own keybinding:</p>

<hr/>

<pre class="code-snippet">
<span class="comment-delimiter"><span class="region">;; </span></span><span class="comment"><span class="region">Toggle two most recent buffers
</span></span><span class="region">(fset 'quick-switch-buffer [?\C-x ?b return])
(global-set-key (kbd </span><span class="string"><span class="region">"s-b"</span></span><span class="region">) 'quick-switch-buffer)
</span</pre>

<hr/>

<p>On my Mac I have bound super (s) to the option key, which opens up a whole world of new possible keybindings.</p>
