<p>What are those line numbers for anyway?</p>

  I don't have line numbers visible in the fringe of my Emacs. If I
  want to go to a line number, that is usually because it is
  referenced in an error message somewhere. Showing them all the time
  is just noise.

  Still, many people want line numbers visible. I guess that is
  because they use them for navigation. This snippet shows line
  numbers temporarily just when you're going to a line number
  with <code>goto-line</code>.

  Notice the nice <code>remap</code>-trick in the key binding. It will
  remap all key bindings from <code>goto-line</code> to
  <code>goto-line-with-feedback</code>. Neat!
